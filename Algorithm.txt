Row minima method Steps (Rule)
Step-1:	In this method, we allocate as much as possible in the lowest cost cell of the first row, i.e. allocate min(si,dj).
Step-2:	
a. Subtract this min value from supply si and demand dj.
b. If the supply si is 0, then cross (strike) that row and If the demand dj is 0 then cross (strike) that column.
c. If min unit cost cell is not unique, then select the cell where maximum allocation can be possible
Step-3:	Repeact this process for all uncrossed (unstriked) rows and columns until all supply and demand values are 0.
